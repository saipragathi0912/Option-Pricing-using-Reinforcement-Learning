# Option Pricing using Reinforcement Learning

## Description

**Option Pricing using Reinforcement Learning** is a project that explores the application of Reinforcement Learning techniques to the domain of financial options pricing. The goal is to develop and evaluate models that can accurately price financial options based on market data and underlying asset behavior. This project serves as an attempt to leverage the power of machine learning to improve pricing accuracy and efficiency in the financial industry.

## Frameworks and Modules Used

- **QuantLib**: QuantLib is a powerful open-source library for quantitative finance. It provides tools for pricing, modeling, and analyzing financial derivatives.

- **Transformer**: Transformers are a fundamental architecture for various machine learning tasks. In this project, Transformers may be used for processing and analyzing financial data.

- **Numpy**: Numpy is a widely used library for numerical computations in Python, and it is particularly useful for handling financial data and mathematical operations.

- **Random**: The Random module is used for generating random numbers and may play a role in simulating financial market scenarios.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a popular library for creating data visualizations. It can be used to visualize the results of option pricing and model performance.
